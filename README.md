Project Overview
This app is a to-do list manager. The user can add items to the list, edit, and delete items. Users can also mark an item as completed when editing an item. There is a drop-down menu that allows the user to filter items based on completion status. Finally, a contact form allows the user to send an email message.

Technology Used: React JS, CSS, Google Fonts, Bootstrap, and Formspree (for email validation)

User Stories
1.	As a university student, I want to create a list of all my upcoming assignments so I can make sure I complete all my assignments.
2.	As a stay-at-home parent, I want to filter which item lists are complete or incomplete so that I can keep track of what I have accomplished thus far.
3.	As a hobbyist who changes his mind a lot, I want to be able to edit or delete list items so that I can change my list.

Future Improvements
1.	I would like to add more options to filter the list such as creation and completion dates.
2.	I want to make the list of items draggable so the user can rearrange the order.
3.	I want to add a feature to let the user save multiple lists.
